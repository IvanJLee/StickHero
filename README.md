# StickHero

Stick Hero is a bridge building game in which you must precisely stretch the stick to cross the platform gaps. The platform widths vary and the stick's length needs to be precise; the stick can't exceed the platform either because you will fall off... It takes a lot of practice to develop a good feeling of the correct length! This game is quite playable on your spare time. What is your best score? Have fun!
